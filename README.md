# simple-webpack-starter
A super simple starting point for playing with JS + SCSS.

### All it does
`/src/entry.js` will be built. Handling for css/scss loaders is built in.

```
npm run dev
```
Makes the app available at `localhost:3000` and starts watchers on everything as well as livereload.

```
npm run build
```
builds the app without starting watchers

```
npm start
```
starts the server
